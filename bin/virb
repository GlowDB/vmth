This tool helps you to debug and browse through results from the
VM test harness. Use to examine the output yaml produced by vmth.

It is an extension to irb, so all irb commands work. The loaded
yaml is stored in global variable $y. To get started use:

load_obj 'filename' 

.. that will load the yaml output into virb.. Then use these
commands to examine the outout..

p_apply 'scenario' # Shows output of apply step

p_test 'scenario' # Shows output of test step

f_apply 'scenario','filename' # Write out a scenario's output to a file

=end
